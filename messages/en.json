    "myText": "I am a frontend developer experienced in React and Next.js, with a deep understanding of TypeScript, Redux, Zustand, and modern frontend tools such as Tailwind CSS and Storybook. I build complex interactive interfaces, optimize application performance, and ensure code cleanliness and maintainability. <br/> I have experience working with REST API, Firebase, version control systems like Git, and modern build and development tools (Vite, Webpack, ESLint). I quickly adapt to new technologies and approaches, and I am able to work both in a team and independently. <br/> For me, it is important to bring projects to completion, making them user-friendly and easy to maintain for the team. I strive to write code that is understandable both for other developers and for myself months later."
