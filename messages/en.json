    "subTitle": "I design reliable and scalable backend solutions with a strong focus on stability and clean architecture",
    "myText": "I am a backend developer specializing in Python and Django. I design REST APIs, build well-structured and logical architectures, and optimize server performance for high-load systems. <br/> I have hands-on experience deploying and administering projects on Ubuntu using Gunicorn, Nginx, and Docker. I pay close attention to security, performance, and application reliability. <br/> I work with PostgreSQL and Redis, integrate third-party services, and set up CI/CD pipelines to ensure stable and predictable releases. <br/> For me, backend development is not just about functionality — it’s about creating thoughtful, reliable, and maintainable systems that are easy for the whole team to understand and evolve. I strive to write clean code that remains clear and manageable long after it’s written, and to build systems that work smoothly without unnecessary complexity."
